Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a set of techniques for dimensionality reduction. It project high dimensional data to a lower space while keeping the maximum information

### Clustering
Clustering is grouping datapoints in a way where simillar data falls into same group and different data will be in different group. Clusting is done in unlabelled dataset.

#### K means Clustering
#### DBSCAN
#### Hirerchical Clustering

## Supervised Learning
#### Decision Tree
#### Random Forest
#### Support Vector Machine
#### K nearest Neighbour
